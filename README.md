## Visualizations

I just discovered p5js, so this year I will try to create some animations about the input I get from AOC.

See: [visualizations](visualizations).

## Screenshots

I gather screenshots at each step (most of) of each years, so that I can make videos about the AOC filling up during december.

See: [screenshots](screenshots).

## Goal

After the 6 last years with Java, Go (finished with Java), OCaml (finished with Java), Python and Clojure (+ some Java), Kotlin, this year I'll be solving the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) with **Kotlin** again.

1. A deep dive into Kotlin.
2. Write fast and idiomatic solutions.
3. Using extensions to make code shorter (see [Extensions.kt](https://github.com/agrison/advent-of-code/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/me/grison/aoc/Extensions.kt)).

I am gradually rewriting all previous years solutions in Kotlin because it's a better language for such challenges than the other I used before (except Python, but I'm not doing so much Python so just forgetting how to write some basic stuff).

## All years

Project is already setup with gradle. To run the app:

* Navigate to top-level directory on the command line
* Run `./gradlew run` to run all days for all years
* Run `./gradlew run --args $DAY` to run a specific day in the current year (*2021*, ex: `./gradlew run --args 8` to run the day 8 of *2021*)
* Run `./gradlew run --args $YEAR/*` to run all days in a specific year (ex: `./gradlew run --args 2015/*` to run the year *2015*)
* Run `./gradlew run --args $YEAR/$DAY` to run a specific year & day (ex: `./gradlew run --args 2015/7` to run the day *7* of *2015*)
* Run `./gradlew run --args input-$DAY` to download the input for a specific day for the current year, provided a `cookie.txt` file in `src/main/resources.txt` which contains your Advent of Code cookie  (ex: `./gradlew run --args input-6` to run the day *6* of *2021*)
* Run `./gradlew run --args input-$YEAR/$DAY` to download the input for a specific day in a specific year, provided a `cookie.txt` file in `src/main/resources.txt` which contains your Advent of Code cookie  (ex: `./gradlew run --args input-2015/7` to run the day *7* of *2015*)

### Testing

* Navigate to top-level directory on the command line
* Run `./gradlew test`
* Add `--info`, `--debug` or `--stacktrace` flags for more output

##### Test input

By default, instantiations of `Day` classes in tests will use the input files in `src/test/resources`, _not_ those in `src/main/resources`.
This hopefully gives you flexibility - you could either just copy the real input into `src/test/resources` if you want to test
the actual answers, or you could add a file of test data based on the examples given on the Advent of Code description for the day.
The stub `Day01Test` class shows a test of the functionality of `Day01` where the test input differs from the actual input.

### Architecture

* Inputs go into `src/main/resources` and follow the naming convention `X.txt` where X is like `01`, `02` and so on
* Solutions go into `src/main/kotlin/days` and extend the `Day` abstract class, calling its constructor with their day number 
* Solutions follow the naming convention `DayX`
* It is assumed all solutions will have two parts but share the same input
* Input is exposed in the solution classes in two forms - `inputList` and `inputString`
* Day 1 solution class and input file are stubbed as a guide on how to extend the project,
and how you can use the `inputList` and `inputString` mentioned above
* To get started simply replace `src/main/01.txt` with the real input and the solutions in `Day01` with your own
* A Day 1 test class also exists, mostly to show a few hamcrest matchers, and how test input files can differ from actual ones (see **Test input** section above).
To get started with testing you can edit this class, and the input file at `src/test/resources/01.txt`
